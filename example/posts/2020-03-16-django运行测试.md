## tronado加速测试
对实现django3.1以后对协程等方法可能有极大对限制，等待测试（这种方法绑定对是django对wsgi而不是asgi）

## Asgi部署测试
> [django异步介绍文档](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/topics/async/#async-to-sync)

<a name="rtUVS"></a>
### uvicorn部署测试
uvicorn是目前django3.1支持的三种异步启动方式之中，着重于速度的部署方式，其支持nginx和gunicorn进行在正式环境中部署，并对cdn、https等提供支持

> 对比测试发现，于django默认等wsgi部署方式相比，静态请求速度下降了1ms，在官方文档中，给出的解释是启动asgi服务器后会对同步请求进行翻译处理，降带来1ms左右的性能下降，在实际生产中，可以忽略不计

#### gunicorn单进程与UvicornWorker部署静态测试
> 速度明显加快，但是没有tornado代理速度快，
